### The complicated introduction
According to Wikipedia, [Java][j-w] is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

### Onward!
Please head to the [Java Wiki Page] for information that is actually helpful!
