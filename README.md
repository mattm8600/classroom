This is **NOT** like a class you would have in school. There are no grades, no credits, nothing. I assume you're here because you want to learn something cool. Before you look at languages though, take a look at the [getting started] section. You can check out all of the programming languages I have to offer down below.

[Java]: #Java

## How this class works
### Distribution
This class is distributed using git, the details of which are described in [Getting started].
### Class Structure
This class is broken up into different languages (only Java for now), each with different sections. Every language has an introductory page that tells you what folders are covered by what wiki pages. The wiki page relevent to the folder you are in has a list of all the files covered and what order to try them out in. I **highly** recommend you follow the order I set out for you - you need a solid foundation to do anything complex. 

## Getting started
This part of the readme is to get you set up with [git], the namesake of this website and the primary way of tracking changes to source code _and_ how you use this class. 

Learning git is an absolutely essential skill for any programmer. If you like, you can take a break from this exhausting block of text and look around GitHub for some cool projects (all built with git, of course). To use this class, you **need** to get set up with git, which  is outlined at the [git introductory wiki page].

## Java
### The complicated introduction
According to Wikipedia, [Java][j-w] is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
### The simple introduction
Like this [1999 Toyota Corolla], Java isn't the most exciting thing in the world. While it may not be as flashy as Swift or Go, it is very reliable and is not going away any time soon. 
### Onward!
Please head to the [Java Wiki Page] for information that is actually helpful!
